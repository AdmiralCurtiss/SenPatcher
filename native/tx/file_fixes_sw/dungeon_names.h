// There are giant consistency issues with some dungeon names where the same dungeon is called
// multiple things depending on where you look. This is a complete mess, I picked my choices here
// depending on what sounds good and what matches the original JP better but it's kinda arbitrary.
// There are defines so we can easily swap them if we figure out what the actual name for any of
// these is supposed to be...

// could also be "Aftermath of the Scarlet Sky"
#define DUNGEON_NAME_m3800 "Scarlet Battlefield"

// could also be "Temple of the Farthest Ends"
#define DUNGEON_NAME_m7500 "Temple at the Farthest End"

// the rest here is likely correct
#define DUNGEON_NAME_m8310 "Pandora - Path of Interstices"
#define DUNGEON_NAME_m8320 "Pandora - Path of Boundaries"
#define DUNGEON_NAME_m8330 "Pandora - Path of Reincarnation"
#define DUNGEON_NAME_m8340 "Pandora - Path of the Afterlife"
#define DUNGEON_NAME_m9810 "Emerald Waterway"
#define DUNGEON_NAME_m9820 "Amber Waterway"
#define DUNGEON_NAME_m9830 "Ice Demon Road"
